= JsTestCore
The JsTestCore library is the core javascript test server library used by several JS Test server libraries.

To hook up your own JS Test framework:
  * You will need to call either JsTestCore::Resources::WebRoot.dispatch_specs or JsTestCore::Resources::WebRoot.dispatch_tests
    depending if you are serving specs or tests.
  * Set JsTestCore.core_path to the directory of the client side test framework (javascript files)
  * Override JsTestCore::Resources::Specs::SpecFile#get or JsTestCore::Resources::Specs::TestFile#get
  * Override JsTestCore::Resources::Specs::SpecDir#get or JsTestCore::Resources::Specs::TestDir#get

NOTE: The current version of JsTestCore does not yet support tests. Support will be added soon.
      I just wanted the test stuff to be in the docs to establish the current architectural direction.
